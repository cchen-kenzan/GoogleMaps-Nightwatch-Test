# GoogleMaps-Nightwatch-Test
I created a set of Nightwatch tests to exercise some features of Google Maps.

Get started:
## 1. Clone
Clone Repo by running the following commands your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/cchen-kenzan/GoogleMaps-Nightwatch-Test.git && cd googleMaps-test
```
## 2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
Note: This will install Selenium and Nightwatch.

## 3. Run FE tests on Google Maps
```
npm run e2e
```
Note: This runs all tests within the e2e folder and currently only has a set of tests for Google Maps.
